BUG - changes on one device aren't reflected on the other until state it reset
pass api gateway url from serverless to react
use esbuild instead of webpack so serverless uses less memory
remove .serverless from git

backend:
    add authenticattion to addMeter and getMeters endpoint
    Add email authentication to signup

frontend:
    Add user settings to nav bar
    Meter containers should be nicer shape
    Add pop up alerts if user can't sign in
    Settings cog on meters card opens up a pop up with full meter details
