BUG - changes on one device aren't reflected on the other until state it reset
pass api gateway url from serverless to react
use esbuild instead of webpack so serverless uses less memory
remove .serverless from git

backend:
    add authenticattion to addMeter and getMeters endpoint
    Add email authentication to signup

frontend:
    Cache data from each meter
    Before adding a meter make an API call to check the details can be fetched
    Add confirmation popup before deleting meter
    Settings cog on meters card opens up a pop up with full meter details
    Add user settings to nav bar
    Changes filtering so that edge periods aren't cut off
    get https?
